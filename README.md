Koch 2D snowflake generator for the game [4D Golf](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh9DXIT3m6N4GygehtlHl0ukgrgPJZteI) by CodeParade.

Downloadable tracks can be found in my [4D-minigolf](https://github.com/madvorak/4D-minigolf) repo.

Note that this is not the standard [Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake) nor the usual 90Â° variant (its corners would overlap in the game).
